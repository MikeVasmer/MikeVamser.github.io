I am a researcher working in the exciting field of quantum information. 
In my work I focus on quantum error correction: making sure that quantum computers function correctly even when some of their components go wrong. 
This research is crucial in the quest to build large-scale quantum computers and also has surprising connections to condensed matter physics and black hole physics!

I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at Perimeter & IQC, working in the group of [Raymond Laflamme](https://laflamme.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/). 
I did my PhD at University College London, where my supervisor was [Dan Browne](https://sites.google.com/site/danbrowneucl/).
