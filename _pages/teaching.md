#### Quantum error correction and fault tolerance, IQC winter 2022

I gave six lectures on fault-tolerant quantum computation as part of this course.
- [Lecture 1](../assets/pdf/lecture1.pdf): Definition of fault-tolerance
- [Lecture 2](../assets/pdf/lecture2.pdf): Fault-tolerant operators part I
- [Lecture 3](../assets/pdf/lecture3.pdf): Fault-tolerant operators part II
- [Lecture 4](../assets/pdf/lecture4.pdf): Universal fault-tolerant gate sets
- [Lecture 5](../assets/pdf/lecture5.pdf): Threshold theorem - definitions and level reduction
- [Lecture 6](../assets/pdf/lecture6.pdf): Threshold theorem - proof and assumptions

My course was heavily inspired by lecture notes by Daniel Gottesman and Dan Browne.
